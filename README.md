# A Rock Paper Scissors Game Implementation in JavaScript

This is a fun little project that is part of The Odin Project's free and open source web development curriculum. At the end of this project, I hope to have demonstrated great problem-solving skills, and an ability to write clean code. 

Above all, this project will display that I have the capacity to grow with every opportunity I'm given and every opportunity I take. This will become very apparent as my portfolio grows and takes shape. 

## How to Play
The game will be played in the browser console. To access the console on your respective browsers, open the HTML file and right-click, and then click "Inspect". This will open your browser's Dev Tools. Navigate to the tab that says "Console". From here, you will be able to play the game. Read further for instructions on how to play.
